# Layers (contrib)
[TOC]

Ops for building neural network layers, regularizers, summaries, etc.

## Higher level ops for building neural network layers.

This package provides several ops that take care of creating variables that are
used internally in a consistent way and provide the building blocks for many
common machine learning algorithms.

- - -

### `tf.contrib.layers.convolution2d(x, num_output_channels, kernel_size, activation_fn=None, stride=(1, 1), padding='SAME', weight_init=_initializer, bias_init=_initializer, name=None, weight_collections=None, bias_collections=None, output_collections=None, trainable=True, weight_regularizer=None, bias_regularizer=None)` {#convolution2d}

Adds the parameters for a conv2d layer and returns the output.

A neural network convolution layer is generally defined as:
\\(y = f(conv2d(w, x) + b)\\) where **f** is given by `activation_fn`,
**conv2d** is `tf.nn.conv2d` and `x` has shape
`[batch, height, width, channels]`. The output of this op is of shape
`[batch, out_height, out_width, num_output_channels]`, where `out_width` and
`out_height` are determined by the `padding` argument. See `conv2D` for
details.

This op creates `w` and optionally `b` and adds various summaries that can be
useful for visualizing learning or diagnosing training problems. Bias can be
disabled by setting `bias_init` to `None`.

The variable creation is compatible with `tf.variable_scope` and so can be
reused with `tf.variable_scope` or `tf.make_template`.

Most of the details of variable creation can be controlled by specifying the
initializers (`weight_init` and `bias_init`) and which collections to place
the created variables in (`weight_collections` and `bias_collections`).

A per layer regularization can be specified by setting `weight_regularizer`.
This is only applied to weights and not the bias.

##### Args:


*  <b>`x`</b>: A 4-D input `Tensor`.
*  <b>`num_output_channels`</b>: The number of output channels (i.e. the size of the
    last dimension of the output).
*  <b>`kernel_size`</b>: A length 2 `list` or `tuple` containing the kernel size.
*  <b>`activation_fn`</b>: A function that requires a single Tensor that is applied as a
    non-linearity.
*  <b>`stride`</b>: A length 2 `list` or `tuple` specifying the stride of the sliding
    window across the image.
*  <b>`padding`</b>: A `string` from: "SAME", "VALID". The type of padding algorithm to
    use.
*  <b>`weight_init`</b>: An optional initialization. If not specified, uses Xavier
    initialization (see `tf.learn.xavier_initializer`).
*  <b>`bias_init`</b>: An initializer for the bias, defaults to 0. Set to`None` in order
    to disable bias.
*  <b>`name`</b>: The name for this operation is used to name operations and to find
    variables. If specified it must be unique for this scope, otherwise a
    unique name starting with "convolution2d" will be created.  See
    `tf.variable_op_scope` for details.
*  <b>`weight_collections`</b>: List of graph collections to which weights are added.
*  <b>`bias_collections`</b>: List of graph collections to which biases are added.
*  <b>`output_collections`</b>: List of graph collections to which outputs are added.
*  <b>`trainable`</b>: If `True` also add variables to the graph collection
    `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES` (see tf.Variable).
*  <b>`weight_regularizer`</b>: A regularizer like the result of
    `l1_regularizer` or `l2_regularizer`. Used for weights.
*  <b>`bias_regularizer`</b>: A regularizer like the result of
    `l1_regularizer` or `l2_regularizer`. Used for biases.

##### Returns:

  The result of applying a 2-D convolutional layer.

##### Raises:


*  <b>`ValueError`</b>: If `kernel_size` or `stride` are not length 2.

### `tf.contrib.layers.fully_connected(x, num_output_units, activation_fn=None, weight_init=_initializer, bias_init=_initializer, name=None, weight_collections=('weights',), bias_collections=('biases',), output_collections=('activations',), trainable=True, weight_regularizer=None, bias_regularizer=None)` {#fully_connected}

Adds the parameters for a fully connected layer and returns the output.

A fully connected layer is generally defined as a matrix multiply:
`y = f(w * x + b)` where `f` is given by `activation_fn`. If
`activation_fn` is `None`, the result of `y = w * x + b` is
returned.

If `x` has shape [\\\(\\text{dim}_0, \\text{dim}_1, ..., \\text{dim}_n\\\)]
with more than 2 dimensions (\\\(n > 1\\\)), then we repeat the matrix
multiply along the first dimensions. The result r is a tensor of shape
[\\\(\\text{dim}_0, ..., \\text{dim}_{n-1},\\\) `num_output_units`],
where \\\( r_{i_0, ..., i_{n-1}, k} =
\\sum_{0 \\leq j < \\text{dim}_n} x_{i_0, ... i_{n-1}, j} \cdot w_{j, k}\\\).
This is accomplished by reshaping `x` to 2-D
[\\\(\\text{dim}_0 \\cdot ... \\cdot \\text{dim}_{n-1}, \\text{dim}_n\\\)]
before the matrix multiply and afterwards reshaping it to
[\\\(\\text{dim}_0, ..., \\text{dim}_{n-1},\\\) `num_output_units`].

This op creates `w` and optionally `b`. Bias (`b`) can be disabled by setting
`bias_init` to `None`.

The variable creation is compatible with `tf.variable_scope` and so can be
reused with `tf.variable_scope` or `tf.make_template`.

Most of the details of variable creation can be controlled by specifying the
initializers (`weight_init` and `bias_init`) and which in collections to place
the created variables (`weight_collections` and `bias_collections`; note that
the variables are always added to the `VARIABLES` collection). The output of
the layer can be placed in custom collections using `output_collections`.
The collections arguments default to `WEIGHTS`, `BIASES` and `ACTIVATIONS`,
respectively.

A per layer regularization can be specified by setting `weight_regularizer`
and `bias_regularizer`, which are applied to the weights and biases
respectively, and whose output is added to the `REGULARIZATION_LOSSES`
collection.

*  <b>`x`</b>: The input `Tensor`.
*  <b>`num_output_units`</b>: The size of the output.
*  <b>`activation_fn`</b>: A function that requires a single Tensor that is applied as a
    non-linearity. If None is used, do not apply any activation.
*  <b>`weight_init`</b>: An optional weight initialization, defaults to
    `xavier_initializer`.
*  <b>`bias_init`</b>: An initializer for the bias, defaults to 0. Set to `None` in
    order to disable bias.
*  <b>`name`</b>: The name for this operation is used to name operations and to find
    variables. If specified it must be unique for this scope, otherwise a
    unique name starting with "fully_connected" will be created.  See
    `tf.variable_op_scope` for details.
*  <b>`weight_collections`</b>: List of graph collections to which weights are added.
*  <b>`bias_collections`</b>: List of graph collections to which biases are added.

*  <b>`trainable`</b>: If `True` also add variables to the graph collection
    `GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES` (see tf.Variable).

    `l1_regularizer` or `l2_regularizer`. Used for weights.
*  <b>`bias_regularizer`</b>: A regularizer like the result of
    `l1_regularizer` or `l2_regularizer`. Used for biases.

### `tf.contrib.layers.xavier_initializer(uniform=True, seed=None, dtype=tf.float32)` {#xavier_initializer}

Returns an initializer performing "Xavier" initialization for weights.

         networks. International conference on artificial intelligence and
         statistics.

This initializer is designed to keep the scale of the gradients roughly the

Returns the summed penalty by applying `regularizer` to the `weights_list`.

Adding a regularization penalty over the layer weights and embedding weights
can help prevent overfitting the training data. Regularization over layer
biases is less common/useful, but assuming proper data preprocessing/mean
subtraction, it usually shouldn't hurt much either.

modules must each a docstring, and `__all__` will contain all symbols with
`@@` references, where that symbol currently exists in the module named
`module_name`.

Returns an initializer that generates tensors without scaling variance.

When initializing a deep network, it is in principle advantageous to keep
the scale of the input variance constant, so it does not explode or diminish
by reaching the final layer. This initializer use the following formula:

    n = fan_in
  elif mode='FAN_OUT': # Count only number of output connections.
    n = fan_out
  elif mode='FAN_AVG': # Average number of inputs and output connections.
    n = (fan_in + fan_out)/2.0

##### Raises:


*  <b>`ValueError`</b>: if `dtype` is not a floating point type.
