# API Documentation

TensorFlow has APIs available in several languages both for constructing and
executing a TensorFlow graph.  The Python API is at present the most complete
and the easiest to use, but the C++ API may offer some performance advantages
in graph execution, and supports deployment to small devices such as Android.

Over time, we hope that the TensorFlow community will develop front ends for
languages like Go, Java, JavaScript, Lua, R, and perhaps others. With
[SWIG](http://swig.org), it's relatively easy to develop a TensorFlow interface
for your favorite language.

Note: Many practical aspects of usage are covered in the Mechanics tab, and
some additional documentation not specific to any particular language API is
available in the Resources tab.
