Holds state in the form of a tensor that persists across steps.

about sharing states in tensorflow.

shape: The shape of the variable tensor.

container: If non-empty, this variable is placed in the given container.
        Otherwise, a default container is used.
shared_name: If non-empty, this variable is named in the given bucket
             with this shared_name. Otherwise, the node name is used instead.

Returns a tensor that may be mutated, but only persists within a single step.

This is an experimental op for internal use only and it is possible to use this
op in unsafe ways.  DO NOT USE unless you fully understand the risks.

It is the caller's responsibility to ensure that 'ref' is eventually passed to a
matching 'DestroyTemporaryVariable' op after all other uses have completed.

Outputs a ref to the tensor state so it may be read or modified.

  E.g.
      var = state_ops._temporary_variable([1, 2], types.float_)
      var_name = var.op.name
      var = state_ops.assign(var, [[4.0, 5.0]])
      var = state_ops.assign_add(var, [[6.0, 7.0]])
      final = state_ops._destroy_temporary_variable(var, var_name=var_name)

ref: A reference to the variable tensor.
shape: The shape of the variable tensor.
dtype: The type of elements in the variable tensor.
var_name: Overrides the name used for the temporary variable resource. Default
value is the name of the 'TemporaryVariable' op (which is guaranteed unique).

Destroys the temporary variable and returns its final value.

Sets output to the value of the Tensor pointed to by 'ref', then destroys
the temporary variable called 'var_name'.
All other uses of 'ref' *must* have executed before this op.
This is typically achieved by chaining the ref through each assign op, or by
using control dependencies.

Outputs the final value of the tensor pointed to by 'ref'.

ref: A reference to the temporary variable tensor.
var_name: Name of the temporary variable, usually the name of the matching
'TemporaryVariable' op.

Update 'ref' by assigning 'value' to it.

ref: Should be from a `Variable` node. May be uninitialized.
value: The value to be assigned to the variable.
validate_shape: If true, the operation will validate that the shape
  of 'value' matches the shape of the Tensor being assigned to.  If false,
  'ref' will take on the shape of 'value'.
use_locking: If True, the assignment will be protected by a lock;

Applies sparse updates to a variable reference.

This operation computes

This operation outputs `ref` after the update is done.
This makes it easier to chain operations that need to use the reset value.

If values in `ref` is to be updated more than once, because there are
duplicate entires in `indices`, the order at which the updates happen
for each value is undefined.

Requires `updates.shape = indices.shape + ref.shape[1:]`.

Duplicate entries are handled correctly: if multiple `indices` reference
the same location, their contributions add.
