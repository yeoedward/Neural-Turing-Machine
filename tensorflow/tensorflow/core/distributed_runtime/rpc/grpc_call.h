// CALL STRUCTURES
// ===============
//
// Each pending (incoming) request corresponds to a call object that
// encapsulates the state of the call. Templates and
// pointers-to-member functions are used to avoid boilerplate and
// redundant closure creation. The class hierarchy is as follows:
//
// * `UntypedCall<Service>`: The base class represents a call that
//   could be associated with any of the methods on a service of type
//   `Service`. Also defines a `Tag` nested class that can be used as
//   the tag in a `grpc::CompletionQueue`.  Each class that
//   instantiates `Service` should have a completion queue polling
//   loop that knows about `UntypedCall<Service>::Tag` objects, and
//   invokes their `OnCompleted()` method to continue processing.
//
// * `Call<Service, GrpcService, Req, Resp>`: This class extends
//   `UntypedCall<Service>` and is additionally parameterized by the
//   gRPC-generated asynchronous service class, and the request and
//   response message types. It defines the state associated with a
//   call (whose type depends on the message types), and stores a
//   pointer to a `Service::HandleFoo()` handler method. Each
//   `Service::HandleFoo()` method knows about the corresponding
//   `Call` type, in order to access its state, and invoke its
//   `SendResponse()` method.
//
// The lifecycle of a call object is as follows.
//
// 1. A `Service` creates a `Call` for a particular method and
//    enqueues it in its completion queue (via an
//    `UntypedCall<Service>::Tag`).
//
// 2. When the tag is returned from `cq_->Next()`, the
//    `UntypedCall::RequestReceived()` method is invoked and takes
//    ownership of the call object. This indirectly invokes the
//    appropriate handler method on `Service`.
//
// 3. After the response has been written (perhaps in another thread),
//    the `Call::SendResponse()` method is invoked. It transfers
//    ownership of the call object back to the completion queue (via
//    an `UntypedCall::Tag`).
//
// 4. When the response has been sent, the tag is returned from
//    `cq_->Next()`, and the call object is deleted.

// Represents a pending request with unknown message types.
