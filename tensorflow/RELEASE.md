# Release 0.7.1

## Bug Fixes and Other Changes

* Added gfile.Open and gfile.Copy, used by input_data.py.
* Fixed Saver bug when MakeDirs tried to create empty directory.
* GPU Pip wheels are built with cuda 7.5 and cudnn-v4, making them
  required for the binary releases. Lower versions of cuda/cudnn can
  be supported by installing from sources and setting the options
  during ./configure
* Fix dataset encoding example for Python3 (@danijar)
* Fix PIP installation by not packaging protobuf as part of wheel,
  require protobuf 3.0.0b2.
* Fix Mac pip installation of numpy by requiring pip >= 1.10.1.
* Improvements and fixes to Docker image.


# Release 0.7.0

## Major Features and Improvements

* Allow using any installed Cuda >= 7.0 and cuDNN >= R2, and add support
  for cuDNN R4
* Added a `contrib/` directory for unsupported or experimental features, 
  including higher level `layers` module
* Added an easy way to add and dynamically load user-defined ops
* Built out a good suite of tests, things should break less!
* Added `MetaGraphDef` which makes it easier to save graphs with metadata
* Added assignments for "Deep Learning with TensorFlow" udacity course 


## Bug Fixes and Other Changes

* Added a versioning framework for `GraphDef`s to ensure compatibility
* Enforced Python 3 compatibility
* Internal changes now show up as sensibly separated commits
* Open-sourced the doc generator
* Un-fork Eigen
* Simplified the `BUILD` files and cleaned up C++ headers
* TensorFlow can now be used as a submodule in another bazel build
* New ops (e.g., `*fft`, `*_matrix_solve`)
* Support for more data types in many ops
* Performance improvements
* Various bugfixes
* Documentation fixes and improvements


## Breaking Changes to the API

* `AdjustContrast` kernel deprecated, new kernel `AdjustContrastv2` takes and
  outputs float only. `adjust_contrast` now takes all data types.
* `adjust_brightness`'s `delta` argument is now always assumed to be in `[0,1]`
  (as is the norm for images in floating point formats), independent of the
  data type of the input image.
* The image processing ops do not take `min` and `max` inputs any more, casting
  safety is handled by `saturate_cast`, which makes sure over- and underflows
  are handled before casting to data types with smaller ranges.
* For C++ API users: `IsLegacyScalar` and `IsLegacyVector` are now gone from
  `TensorShapeUtils` since TensorFlow is scalar strict within Google (for
  example, the shape argument to `tf.reshape` can't be a scalar anymore).  The
  open source release was already scalar strict, so outside Google `IsScalar`
  and `IsVector` are exact replacements.
* The following files are being removed from `tensorflow/core/public/`:
    * `env.h` -> `../platform/env.h`
    * `status.h` -> `../lib/core/status.h`
    * `tensor.h` -> `../framework/tensor.h`
    * `tensor_shape.h` -> `../framework/tensor_shape.h`
    * `partial_tensor_shape.h` -> `../framework/partial_tensor_shape.h`
    * `tensorflow_server.h` deleted
* For C++ API users: `TensorShape::ShortDebugString` has been renamed to
  `DebugString`, and the previous `DebugString` behavior is gone (it was
  needlessly verbose and produced a confusing empty string for scalars).
* `GraphOptions.skip_common_subexpression_elimination` has been removed. All
  graph optimizer options are now specified via
  `GraphOptions.OptimizerOptions`.
* `ASSERT_OK` / `EXPECT_OK` macros conflicted with external projects, so they
  were renamed `TF_ASSERT_OK`, `TF_EXPECT_OK`.  The existing macros are
  currently maintained for short-term compatibility but will be removed.
* The non-public `nn.rnn` and the various `nn.seq2seq` methods now return
  just the final state instead of the list of all states.
* `tf.scatter_update` now no longer guarantees that lexicographically largest
  index be used for update when duplicate entries exist.
* `tf.image.random_crop(image, [height, width])` is now
  `tf.random_crop(image, [height, width, depth])`, and `tf.random_crop` works
  for any rank (not just 3-D images).  The C++ `RandomCrop` op has been replaced
  with pure Python.
* Renamed `tf.test.GetTempDir` and `tf.test.IsBuiltWithCuda` to
  `tf.test.get_temp_dir` and `tf.test.is_built_with_cuda` for PEP-8
  compatibility.
* `parse_example`'s interface has changed, the old interface is accessible in
  `legacy_parse_example` (same for related functions).
* New `Variable`s are not added to the same collection several times even if
  a list with duplicates is passed to the constructor.
* The Python API will now properly set the `list` member of `AttrValue` in
  constructed `GraphDef` messages for empty lists.  The serialization of some
  graphs will change, but the change is both forwards and backwards compatible.
  It will break tests that compare a generated `GraphDef` to a golden serialized
  `GraphDef` (which is discouraged).

# Release 0.6.0

## Major Features and Improvements

* Python 3.3+ support via changes to python codebase and ability
  to specify python version via ./configure.

* Some improvements to GPU performance and memory usage:
  [convnet benchmarks](https://github.com/soumith/convnet-benchmarks/issues/66)
  roughly equivalent with native cudnn v2 performance.  Improvements mostly due
  to moving to 32-bit indices, faster shuffling kernels.  More improvements to
  come in later releases.


## Bug Fixes

* Lots of fixes to documentation and tutorials, many contributed
  by the public.

* 271 closed issues on github issues.

## Backwards-Incompatible Changes

* `tf.nn.fixed_unigram_candidate_sampler` changed its default 'distortion'
  attribute from 0.0 to 1.0. This was a bug in the original release
  that is now fixed.

# Release 0.5.0

Initial release of TensorFlow.
